# 	They must begin with a letter or an underscore
# 	Can contain letters, number or underscore and cannot begin with a number
# 	Are case sensitive

# type(var) - gives the type of variable

# 	Python uses dynamic typing - can reassign variable to different data types

# Strongly typed - if you add an int to a string or vice versa it'll throw error, Java does this by converting an int to string... python dosen't

# 	We can assign multiple variables at the same time 
# 		a=b=c=d=12 - all these vars have been assigned 12
# 		a, b = 12, 13 - will assign a, b to 12, 13 respectively
# 		a, b = b, a - will swap the values, assigning a, b to 13, 12 respectively 
		
# Data types -
# 	Several built-in data types, they can be classed as - 
# 	numeric, iterator, sequence (also iterators), mapping, file, class, exception
# 	Basic data types are -
# 		int, float, str, list, tup, set, dict, bool
