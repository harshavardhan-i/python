# Python version 3.6 introduced something called f strings… it's not backwards compatible
# So it won't work on earlier versions
# age = 9
# Print( f"Hello, I'm {age}years old") - by prefixing f infront the statement age variable can now be used directly within replacement fields..
# String formatting can also be used here…
# Print(f"The value of pie is - {22/7: 12.50f}") - this will still work and print the correct decimal values

# String interpolation…
# This has been deprecated and would be removed from the language at some point…
# Should not be used for any python 3 program

# Age = 23
# Print("My age is %d years" % age) - prints "My age is 23 years"…
# time = "years"
# %d, %f, %s - are used for integers, floating numbers and strings respectively…
# Print("MY age is %d %s. Value of pie is %60.50f" % (age, time, (22/7))) - multiple variable injections
