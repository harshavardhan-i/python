# 	String are immutable in python
# 	Strings are ordered sequences 
# 	Can be encased with single quote or double quotes
# 	No difference between single and double quotes in python
# 	Must start and end with the same type of quotes

# String concatenation - "+" operator concatenates  two string literals
# input("Please enter something") - input func takes input from the console and returns string

# String interpolation - Ways of formatting a string to print variable within it

# Escape character
# backslash is used as a escape character in string and give special meaning to the following characters
# 	\n - new line
# 	\t - tab space, usually 4 chars space but varies across terminals
# 	\' - prints '
# 	\" - prints " 

# Or alternatively use """ triple double quotes... then no need of escape sequence,it also supports splitting over multiple lines e.x. 
# """ this
# line is
# split into 3"""
# and that will run without errors and print three lines, 
# """ this \
# line is \
# split into 3"""
# adding backslash here removes the new line and prints all in one line.

# \\ - escapes backslash, prints \
# r"\" - raw strings, adding r before string literal prints raw texts, meant to be used for regular expressions. 

# For typecasting we can use int("strArgs"), returns a int
