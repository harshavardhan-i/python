# Focus on version 3.7 and 2.7
# Created in 1990 by Guido van Rossum
# Python 3 was released in 2008
# It is object oriented and a interpreted language
# Named after cult comedy show Monty Python's Flying Circus
# Interpreted - The program is converted to ML on the fly line by line
# Data in Python is strongly typed, Adding no. to a string would throw error... Also dynamically typed so no variable declaration
# One of the three official coding languages at google.
# Broken backward compatibility, meaning no guarantee Python 2 will work with python 3 interpreter.
# Python 2.7 being the final version and no longer supported after 2019
