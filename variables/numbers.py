# Numeric data types - 
# int, float, complex, Decimal

# int - numbers without fractions, significantly faster computations compared to float
# float - numbers with fractional parts

# int - there's no limit the size of values you can store in Python int
# float - max float value is limited and also for it's min value, they have a 52 digits of precision, if needed more Decimal can be used in Python 3

# Numeric operators...
# +, -, *, /, //(rounded down towards minus infinity), %

# a/b - integer division might yield float, to prevent this use //
# // - also called "integer divided by"…
# Also a proof the python is a strongly typed language

# Expression - anything that can be calculated to return a value, literal values are also expressions
# A= 4 , here a is not a expression while 4 is… because a is being bound to 4!

# Operator precedence…

# Mathematical rule - BODMAS…  bracket, order of, division/ multiplication, addition/ subtraction 
# Holds the same precedence for python operators…
# Division and multiplication holds the same precedence & addition and subtraction holds the same precedence 
# In an expression with a mix of + and - it's evaluated from left to right
