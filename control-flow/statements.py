# 	• Works in blocks of code... 
# 	• Does not use delimiters like {}, or BEGIN and END
# 	• Uses indentation instead
# 	• Each level of indentation is new block of code
# 	• If a line ends in colon python expects a new block with indentation
# 	• Input() func returns str i.e. a string
# 	• int(var) - takes in argument and converts it to int data type, can crash if arguments are not valid
# 	• if  - if keyword followed by expression without parenthesis for if condition eg.
# 	if age>18:                                                           (Conditional Statement)
# 		print("Adult")
# 	else:
# 		print("Child")
# 	elif: - used to check multiple conditions, must appear before else block

# Conditional operators - <, >, ==, <=, >=, !=
# 	• # - Is used for comment
# 	• and -  keyword for and condition
# 	• or -  keyword for or condition

# Simplify chained condition - 
# 	if 18 <= age <= 30:
# 		print("Young adult")

# 	• With and python stops checking as soon as it finds False
# 	• Similarly for or  it stops checking as soon as it finds True

# Augmented Assignments…
# 	• Just a short hand notation for sum = sum + 1
# 	• I.e. sum+=1
# 	• In the first case the operation is performed original sum var is destroyed and new value is assigned to the new sum variable
# 	• In the second case the original variable is modified instead wherever possible
