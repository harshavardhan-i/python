# Several ways of repeating code blocks…
# 	• for loops
# 	• while loops
# 	• list comprehension and generator expressions

# for loop…
# 	parrot=  "Norwegian Blue"
# 	• for character in parrot - gets each character in parrot string
# 	• char.isnumeric() - tells if the character is numeric or not
# 	• name the python file not as "range" as it may conflict with the range in python

# Range…
# 	• for I  in range(1, 20) - Here loop goes from 1 to 19, not including 20
# 	• for I  in range( 20) - Starts with 0 and upto 19
# 	• for I  in range(1, 20, 2) - starts with 1, upto 19 and takes a step of 2
# 	• for I  in range(20, 1, -1) - starts with 20, upto 1 and takes -1 step
# 	• if age in range(1, 19) - checks if the age var is in 1 to 18…
# 	• if item in item_list - executes the block if the item is in the list

# Continue…
# 	• continue causes the entire line after in a loop to be skipped
# Break…
# 	• break causes the loop to terminate execution
# Pass
# 	• Does nothing at all, usually used as a placeholder for loops

# None - is a constant in python used to signify "no value" or like "null" in java

# while loop…
# 	• while I <10 : - runs the code block till var I equals 9 and stops

# 	• For loops are used when the sequence size is predetermined
# 	• where as while loops are used when loop iterations are not pre defined, used for files and internet streams

# else in a loop…
# 	• Use it when you execute a block when the loop itself terminates normally(without breaks, or returns etc..)
# 	• for number in numbers:
# 		○ if number % 8 == 0:
# 			§ break;
# 	else:
# 		print("The numbers are not divisible by 8")
# 	• In the above example the else runs along with the for loop

# 	• Looping through dictionary
# 	• 
# 	• d.values can be used to access dictionary values
# 	• 
	
# 	• 
# 	• Ignores the items if the list contains extra
