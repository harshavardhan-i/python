# 	• Boolean value can either be True or False
# 	• Can only hold two values
# 	• Python has two constants True, False
# 	• age > 16 - a boolean expression
# 	• age variable must be assigned a value before comparison or it throws an error
# 	• not - it's used to reverse the boolean value
# 	• not True - False
# 	• not False - True
# 	• and  has a higher precedence that or

# Truthy values…
# Values that evaluate to false :-
# 	• Constants - None & False
# 	• Zero of any numeric type be it float, fraction 
# 	• Empty sequence and collections

# in and not in…
# 	parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
# 	letter = input("Enter a character: ")
	
# 	• if letter in parrot: - in operator checks if letter exists in parrot, it's case sensitive
# 	• not in - similarly not in checks the opposite of in
# 	• letter.casefold() - converts the string to lowercase, better than lower().. some languages have different lower case characters like German and casefold handles them.
