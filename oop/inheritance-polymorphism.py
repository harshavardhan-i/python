	# • Inheritance is used to reuse the code written and reduce the complexity of code
	# • 
	# • To inherit a class pass it as arguments to the inheritor class
	# • Inheriting class is called derived class
	# 	○ Animal is the base class
	# 	○ Dog is the derived class
	# • Animal .init creates an instance of that class within Dog
	# • we can overwrite any method by redefining it within dog
	
	
	# • Polymorphism ?
	# • 
	# • Here multiple classes can utilize the same speak method, so it's polymorphism
