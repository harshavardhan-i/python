# Dictionary - Is a data type in python and holds set of data in a key:value pair
# dict["key"] - Way to access the values of a particular "key"

# There are many ways of creating dataframes, two of the many being....
# 	1. from list of dictionaries - dataframe is built row by row
# 	list_of_dicts = [ {key : value}, {key : value}, {key:value}]...it's a list of rows
# 	pd.DataFrame(list_of_dictionaries) - converts the list of dicts into a dataframe
	
# 	2. from dictionary of lists - constructed column by column
# 	dict_of_lists = { key: [val], key: [val], key: [val] }... dictionary of columns
# 	key = col Name, vale = col values 
# 	pd.DataFrame(dict_of_lists) - converts the dictionary into dataframe
