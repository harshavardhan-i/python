# 	• Unordered collection
# 	• No duplicate in the collection
# 	• There is no indexing
	
# Dictionary - is a key value pair and values are accessed by key not the index. Dictionaries are mappings not sequences
# E.x. 
# fruit = { "orange": "a sweet, orange, citrus fruit",
# 		"apple": "good for making cider"}
# fruit["orange"] - prints the value of key orange
# 	• Dictionary keys must be immutable
# 	• Keys must be immutable
# 	• Keys themselves must be strings
# 	• Lists can't be used as a key but tuples can
# 	• Reassigning to a key replaces the value

# fruit["newFruit"] = "A new fruit"- Adds a new fruit to the dictionary
# 	• No method or function to add new key to the dictionary
# 	• Keys are unique in a dictionary
# fruit = { "orange": "a sweet, orange, citrus fruit",
# 		"apple": "good for making cider",
# 		"apple": "good for making cider"}
# 	• This kind of assignment does not throw an error

# 	• fruit.keys(), fruit.values(), fruit.items()
